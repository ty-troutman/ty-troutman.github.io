    "text": "In the Troutman Lab, established in July 2021, we couple cellular and molecular immunology approaches to quantitative analyses of dynamic epigenetic factors ultimately controlling gene expression. With these approaches, we discover novel intercellular and intracellular mechanisms controlling tissue myeloid cell behaviors during health and disease.\n\nCurrent Projects\n\nMacrophages in inflammation and obesity\nThe biological systems of inflammation and metabolism are closely intertwined, and tissue macrophages are key immune cells linking these systems. In addition to their roles as sentinels of infection, macrophages also contribute to obesity-associated diseases. \nFor example, certain diets can drive tissue accumulation of inflammatory lipids and augment intestinal permeability. These inflammatory lipid species and products of the leaky gut may result in local and systemic inflammation. \nOne documented consequence is the development of insulin resistance and increased obesity, driven by adipose tissue – recruited macrophages. Additionally, hepatic macrophages lining the liver sinusoids become more susceptible to death and inflammatory dysregulation. These hepatic macrophages function to clear microbes and microbial products draining from the intestine, and absence and dysregulation of these hepatic macrophages may exacerbate systemic inflammation. \nOne area of interest in the Troutman Lab is to define molecular mechanisms controlling tissue macrophage behaviors resulting from inflammation and obesity.\n\n\nGenetic variation and control of macrophage behaviors\nNormal tissue behaviors depend on a network of cell populations functioning together to support organ function. Disease may result if the system becomes unbalanced in one or more constituent cell types. Some diseases have known lesions in a single causal gene. However, most diseases result from the polygenic background of a susceptible individual interacting with a range of environmental factors. Thus, the susceptibility of a tissue to develop disease may be governed by interactions of the genetic background with one or more environmental factors. Notable examples include Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, steatohepatitis and cirrhosis and atopic diseases. In these cases, certain populations are resistant to disease progression in the context of similar environmental triggers. \nGenome-wide association studies provide the identities of susceptibility loci for many complex diseases. These susceptibility loci often lie in noncoding regions of the genome, which suggest that they function by regulating gene expression. However, different cell lineages can select divergent sets of noncoding regulatory elements controlling cell fate and function. Therefore, improving mechanistic understanding of the genetic and environmental factors interacting to promote disease may require knowledge of the cell types actively using the mutated DNA elements. The Troutman Lab studies these interactions using purified cells from inbred mouse strains. Gene regulatory differences between the model genomes are assessed using experimental conditions that fix the contribution of environmental effects. This enables defining cell autonomous and non–cell autonomous roles for naturally occurring genetic variation in controlling macrophage behaviors. Although the locations of gene regulatory elements have diverged between humans and mice, the mechanisms controlling gene regulation and the functional properties of macrophages remain highly conserved between the two species. Thus, the prevalence of mutations in mouse macrophages affecting the binding of a certain transcription factor may cause similar outcomes in humans."

They are not all appropriately GC balanced though. These UDI barcodes are purchased in sets of 96 adapters. We purchased set 4 (barcodes 289:384) and were gifted small aliquots of set 1 (1:96) and set 2 (97:192) from the labs’ of Chris Glass and Sven Heinz at UC San Diego.\nAdapter stocks are delivered at 25 µM and diluted to 0.625 µM in 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (10X T4 ligase buffer, NEB #B0202S; dilute 1:10 with ultra-pure water to obtain 1X buffer). Diluted stocks are further diluted to 0.25 µM as routine use aliquots. Typically, 0.5 to 1 µl of the working aliquot is adequate for adapter ligation.

If you are using Linux, your distro may already provide a package.\n# if you are on the HPC cluster, you will need to load a python/3.x module\nmodule load python3\n\n# install the latest release from GitLab using pip\npip install --user https://tfinternal.research.cchmc.org/gitlab/databank/seq-core-ngs-downloader/-/archive/master/seq-core-ngs-downloader-master.zip\n\n# make sure it works; otherwise, see the 'Updating Your PATH' section below\nngsdl --help\n\n# …or try this as a backup\npython -m cchmc_seq_core --help\nOlder versions of pip may require you to download the and manually extract the .zip file from GitLab first, like this:\ncurl -LOJ https://tf.cchmc.org/s/e1f9a\nunzip seq-core-ngs-downloader*.zip && rm -f seq-core-ngs-downloader*.zip\ncd seq-core-ngs-downloader*\npip install --user .\n\n# optionally delete the downloaded source code\ncd .. && rm -rf seq-core-ngs-downloader*\n\nUpdating Your PATH\nIf you install with pip install --user, that precludes the need for a virtual environment (see below), but necessitates that you manually add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if you want to be able to run this script from an arbitrary directory:\n# recommended place for PATH modifications is ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile\ntest -f ~/.bash_profile && \\\n  echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile || \\\n  echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.profile\n\n# you will need to log out and back in to see the changes\nSome Linux distros do this by default now.\nOn a Mac, pip installs things to your (hidden) ~/Library folder. You will need to add $HOME/Library/Python/<python_maj.minor_version>/bin to your $PATH when using the system default Python, where <python_maj.minor_version> would be something like “2.7”, depending on which version of the OS you have.\n\n\n\nSetup for Local Development\nIf you are just experimenting, and don’t want to mess with setting your $PATH or potentially needing sudo to install, here’s a sure bet:\nGITLAB=https://tfwebdev.research.cchmc.org/gitlab\ngit clone $GITLAB/databank/seq-core-ngs-downloader\ncd seq-core-ngs-downloader\n\nvirtualenv venv      # or, possibly: python3 -m venv venv\n. venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment\npip install -e .     # install using the 'setup.py' in the local directory\n\nngsdl --help         # make sure it works in the virtualenv\nThis repository includes a setuptools setup.py, which you can run in the usual way, if that’s your thing: python setup.py [--help | install]."

After your access is enabled, you should be able to login to the cluster with your CCHMC employee network credentials. All users have a default disk (home directory) quota of 100 GB and a job walltime quota of 10000 hours per quarter, which is free. The quota of your home directory is fixed, and cannot be changed. To increase the walltime, please send an email to Cluster Support.\nYour home directory is accessible at the path /users/YOURUSERID and has a default 100 GB quota. You also have access to a “scratch” volume at /scratch/YOURUSERID, where there is a 100 GB quota with a burst of up to 5 TB for up to 7 days. Anything there will be removed after 60 days. Users typically do not have (read/write) access to other users’ home directories. Thus, /data/hpc-troutman/ is the place to store data/analysis (not personal files) that anyone else in the lab might ever need to work with."

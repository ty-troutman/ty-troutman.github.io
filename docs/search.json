So keep this place organized!\nRaw and archival data belong in /hpc-troutman/data within the appropriate sub-directories. ALL lab funded fastq files must be immediately archived in /data/hpc-troutman/data/archive and the location deposited in Sequencing Sample Database. Common tag directories or bam files passing standard QC steps should be organized in /data/hpc-troutman/data/processed and logged in the database. Genome builds are found in /data/hpc-troutman/data/genomes.\nAnalysis and results belong in /data/hpc-troutman/member/&lt;username&gt;/. Ty doesn’t care if you look through his analyses and code (don’t edit or delete anything). Other people don’t like snooping on their computer files. Be courteous, get permission before digging into personal directories on /data/hpc-troutman/member/.\nWe currently have 7 TB of space here. Don’t store unnecessary redundant files or sam files here. Use /data/troutman-nobackup/&lt;username&gt; if needed for temporary storage of sam files.\n\n\n/data/troutman-nobackup/&lt;username&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThis drive is not backed up!\n\n\n/data/troutman-nobackup/&lt;username&gt; is for bursty application that exceed space limits in your personal scratch folder. We currently have 10 TB of space here, which can dissappear fast with genetic variation analyses. You may be requested to purge your files when the drive approaches capacity. Organization is not required. It is billed at $0.10/GB/year.\n\n\nAccess\nTy Troutman and Melissa Mingler are authorizers for both /data/hpc-troutman and /data/troutman-nobackup. Either can grant/revoke access permissions. Access is managed using the permissions software located at here. Your login information is the same as your network id and password.\nConnect to the CCHMC cluster by following the instructions here. You can access the drive through the terminal, Citrix, or:\n\nPC via \\\\bmiisi.chmcres.cchmc.org\\hpc-troutman or \\\\bmiisi.chmcres.cchmc.org\\troutman-nobackup\nMac via smb://bmiisi.chmcres.cchmc.org/hpc-troutman or smb://bmiisi.chmcres.cchmc.org/troutman-nobackup\nMore detailed instructions\n\nIf you want to request a new storage volume for research data on the cluster, or manage space for an existing one, visit the BMI Store.

Rerun fastqc on the trimmed fastq files. Trim Galore can automatically do this for you.\nAlign the data with STAR. Have STAR format the alignment as a sorted BAM file.\nUse HOMER to generate tag directories from the STAR alignment BAM file. Use the -sspe -flip options if the data is generated using our lab’s dUTP protocol, which is strand specific and reports on the opposite strand from the original molecule.\n``` bash\nmakeTagDirectory &lt;tagDirectoryName&gt; &lt;filename.sam&gt; -genome &lt;experiment_genome&gt; \\ -checkGC -format sam -sspe -flip\n```\nOmit -sspe if the sequencing data is not paired end, and omit -flip if the sequencing reads will not align to the opposite DNA strand as in “first-strand” library synthesis protocols.\nUse Samtools to index the sorted BAM files.\n\n\n\nData quality control\n\nUse the fastqc results to check basic data quality.\nCheck data assumptions and quality using a local install of the Integrative Genomics Viewer. An alternative would be to load a HOMER makeUCSCfile into the UCSC Genome Browser. An even better solution is to load HOMER makeMultiWigHub.pl tracks to the UCSC Genome Browser using a lab web server. We have a web server for this purpose, but the resource is not functional yet.\nCheck mapping efficiency using the STAR alignment log file.\nCheck other basic quality parameters using the HOMER tagInfo.txt, tagLengthDistribution.txt, and tagCountDistribution.txt files. These files will be found in the HOMER tag directory.\nCheck sequence bias using the HOMER tagFreq.txt and tagFreqUniq.txt. These files will also be in the HOMER tag directory. Fastqc also reports on sequencing bias.\n\nMany of these QC parameters can quickly be summarized using MultiQC. This software is not currently available on the BMI cluster but can be run locally. Installation is easy via Docker.\nIn order to run MultiQc from your local machine, you will need to do one of the following: mount the server folder as a drive on your local machine (good idea), or copy the data from the server to your local machine (bad idea). Instructions for mounting the drives can be found here and here.\nOnce a drive is mounted and the Docker software is opened, the Multiqc docker image can be run through your terminal application on your local machine as in the example described here and provided below:\ndocker run -t -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` ewels/multiqc multiqc ./path/to/mounted/drive Another useful tool is alignStats.R, which generates a table containing selected information from the STAR log file and the HOMER tagInfo.txt file. This tool is described in more detail below.\n\n\nData quantification\n\nQuantify sequencing reads using HOMER [analyzeRepeat.pl](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/analyzeRNA.html).\nCompare gene detection depth by plotting distribution of normalized transcript counts at various thresholds.\nValidate experimental replicates and treatment differences with log transformed data using principal component analysis and/or pairwise correlation analysis.\nCompare expression of some control and test genes using bar plots, box whisker plots, and/or a genome browser.\nCompare global expression profiles with log transformed data by heat map. Assess global expression profiles with and without row scaling.\n\n\n\nDifferential expression analysis\n\nDifferential expression analysis should be used cautiously if data fails QC steps or statistical method assumptions.\nIdentify deferentially expressed genes with raw sequencing counts (non-normalized data) using DeSeq2. This can be done directly with DeSeq2 in R, or it can be done through HOMER using getDiffExpression.pl.\nResults can be summarized genome wide with various types of scatter plots or heat maps.\nCheck biological function of differential genes using gene ontology tools. Examples include: Metascape, ToppGene or ToppFun, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Qiagen Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ($$$), etc.\n\n\n\nAnalytical creativity\nAnalysis of RNA-seq data is only limited by the quality of the data and your imagination. Consider intersecting your results with data from other systems, experiments, or genomics assays as a way to develop and refine new hypotheses."

We have access to a few automated pipelines to help streamline these steps. However, it is a good idea to learn how to use the above tools in an independent workflow. And to learn how to apply the various options as best suited to your data type/assumptions. Becoming over reliant on automated processing and analysis will limit understanding, independence, and creativity.\n\nmap_on_bmi_hpc (in progress!)\nPresently, the lab has independent wrapper scripts individually tailored for single-read or paired-end RNA-seq data, or single-read or paired-end ChIP-seq or ATAC-seq data. Eventually these scripts will be merged into an integrated tool that functions via specification of command line options.\nThese wrapper scripts takes an input directory path of grouped data and generate and submit a series of batch .bat files on the BMI High Performance Cluster. Users have the option to specify variables specific to their data or use default specified parameters. The submitted batch files automate execution of the following: fastqc, trim_galore, data alignment, tag directory creation, and sorting and indexing alignment bam files.\nThese scripts can be run from the lab’s cluster drive or added as executables to your path. Current versions are located at:\n    /data/hpc-troutman/software/scripts/working_wrapper_star_paired.R\n    /data/hpc-troutman/software/scripts/working_wrapper_bowtie2_pairedend.R\n    /data/hpc-troutman/software/scripts/working_wrapper_bowtie2_singleread.R\nUsage on the cluster requires a loaded R module.

These tools require an input sample definition file. This is a 4 column table for RNA-Seq or ATAC-Seq and 5 column table for ChIP-Seq. The table must be formatted as ‘tab’ separated (\\t) and should not contain a header row.\n\nEach row in the table corresponds to a data group.\nThe first column is the name of the group.\nThe second column defines the color of the group. This can contain default R colors or hex formatted color codes (example: #de2d26).\nThe third column contains the paths to each HOMER tag directory belonging to the data group. Each sample/replicate directory for the group must be separated by a semicolon ; (no space!).\nThe fourth column contains the name assigned to each sample. Each sample/replicate name for the group must be separated by a semicolon ; (no space!). The order and number of sample names should be the same as the tag directories in column 3.\n\nAn example follows (omit the header column):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColumn 1\nColumn 2\nColumn 3\nColumn 4\n\n\n\n\ngroup1\ngray0\n/path/to/tag_directory/group1_rep1/;/path/to/tag_directory/group1_rep2/\ngroup1_rep1;group1_rep2\n\n\ngroup2\ngray33\n/path/to/tag_directory/group2_rep1/;/path/to/tag_directory/group2_rep2/\ngroup2_rep1;group2_rep2\n\n\ngroup3\ngray66\n/path/to/tag_directory/group3_rep1/;/path/to/tag_directory/group3_rep2/\ngroup3_rep1;group3_rep2\n\n\n\nThe GitHub versions are not fully functional on the BMI cluster, but we have edited versions suppressing the non-functional aspects (makeMultiWigHub.pl).\n####rnaPipe.R rnaPipe.R is a full featured wrapper script that executes the below three tools in series, generating a summary stats file called alignStats.txt, data quantification results in a directory called rnaQuan/, and differential expression results in a directory called rnaDiff/. These tools require a compatible R module is loaded when run through the BMI HPC. An example usage follows:\n    module load R/4.2.1\n    rnaPipe.R /path/to/sample_definition_file -o /desired/output/path -g available_homer_genome\nSteps from rnaPipe.R can also be run/rerun individually, and some have additional analysis options available. Script instructions and available options can be viewed by entering the command into the terminal.\n\nalignStats.R\nalignStats.R compiles various quality control statistics into a summary table based on what is in the sample definition file. An example usage follows:\n    Rscript alignStats.R /path/to/sample_definition_file &gt; alignStats.txt\n\n\nrnaQuan.R\nrnaQuan.R performs routine quantification of RNA-seq data by reading in the sample definition file and using HOMER and R to perform the following: - Generate an analyzeRepeats.pl raw sequencing count file (-raw or -noadj) specifying the options -condenseGenes -count exons. - Generate an analyzeRepeats.pl TPM normalized file (-tpm option) specifying the option -count exons but not -condenseGenes. This file is subsetted based on accession numbers within the raw count file. - Short genes (less than 200 bp) are removed, and a simplified raw file (rawC.txt) and TPM file (rawT.txt) are created. - A series of plots are created that: compare gene length versus expression means and variance; assess data grouping using principal component analyses; compare pair-wise Parson’s correlations using heat maps and within group 2d kernel density plots. - Group replicate tag directories are merged into a mergeTag folder. - A UCSC genome browser hub track is created using the sample definition file name. This aspect will not function until the web server and script are correctly configured.\nAn example usage follows:\n    Rscript rnaQuan.R /path/to/sample_definition_file -o rnaQuan\n\n\nrnaDiff.R\nrnaDiff.R performs group pairwise differential expression analysis using DeSeq2 as. This depends both on the sample definition file and the processed raw count and TPM files generated by rnaQuan.R. It generates the following: - DeSeq2 results for any gene above a declared TPM threshold (default 8) for each pairwise comparison between each group (not one group versus all remaining). - Scatter plots and MA plots visualizing expression differences between each pair of groups. - A series of summary heat map for the composite list of deferentially expressed genes between all groups.\nAn example usage is follows:\n    Rscript rnaDiff.R /path/to/sample_definition_file -c rnaQuan/rawC.txt -t rnaQuan/rawT.txt -o rnaDiff/\nThese scripts can be run from the lab’s cluster drive or added as an executable to your path. Current versions are located at /data/hpc-troutman/software/scripts/."

These adapters are for use in ligation chemistry (lab standard dUTP RNA-seq and ChIP-seq protocols). They contain a unique 8 nucleotide index in the P5 (i5) and P7 (i7) sequence.\nThese UDI barcodes are purchased in sets of 96 adapters. We purchased set D (barcodes 289:384) and were gifted small aliquots of set A (1:96) and set B (97:192) from the labs’ of Chris Glass and Sven Heinz at UC San Diego.\nEach pair was designed with a Hamming distance of at least 3 across the entire series of 384 UDI barcodes, meaning any two or more chosen NEXTFLEX UDI adapters in the entire set are internally compatible with themselves. They are not all appropriately GC balanced though. Each consecutive pair of barcodes found in columns 1 and 2 are fully color balanced and are suitable to be used in a pool of two samples. When designing low-plexity index pools, always include two libraries barcoded with a set of two unique and fully color balanced barcodes to avoid laser color complexity issues during de-multiplexing.\nAdapter stocks are delivered at 25 µM and diluted to 0.625 µM in 1X T4 DNA ligase buffer (10X T4 ligase buffer, NEB #B0202S; dilute 1:10 with ultra-pure water to obtain 1X buffer). Diluted stocks are further diluted to 0.25 µM as routine use aliquots. Typically, 0.5 to 1 µl of the working aliquot is adequate for adapter ligation. Barcoded libraries are amplified using NEXTFLEX common primer sequences.\nNEXTFLEX PCR Primer 1: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC \nNEXTFLEX PCR Primer 2: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT\n\nNEXTFLEX i5 Adapter: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACXXXXXXXXACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT\nNEXTFLEX i7 Adapter: GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACXXXXXXXXATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nXXXXXXXX denotes the i5 or i7 index region of the adapter.\n\n\n\n\n‘Nextera’ Tn5 Barcoding Primers\nBuenrostro et. al. Nature, 2015. PMID: 26083756.\nNextera Tn5 transposase barcoding primers for (ATAC-seq and other suitable transposase chemistry libraries) were sourced from the labs’ of Howard Chang and William Greenleaf (Supplementary Table 1 of the linked manuscript). Each primer contains a unique 8 nucleotide index. Combinatorial or unique i7 and i7 primers are selected for each sample and are used as primers for PCR amplification of ATAC-seq libraries.\nPrimers were ordered from IDT as standard oligonucleotides and suspended at 10 µM in low-EDTA TE buffer. Reconstituted primers stocks are stored at -20C. Working aliquots should be used routinely in place of the stocks.\nNextera Tn5 i5 Primer Sequence: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACXXXXXXXXTCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTAT\nNextera Tn5 i7 Primer Sequence: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATXXXXXXXXGTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTG\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nXXXXXXXX denotes the i5 or i7 index region of the primer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n\nFor barcoded adapters added via ligation (e.g. NEXTFLEX UDI, standard TruSeq style Y-adapters):\n\nIndex 1 (i7) is always read in the direction (5’ to 3′) of the sequence in the oligo.\nindex 2 (i5) is read in the direction of the oligo for Miseq and NovaSeq v1 chemistry.\nIndex 2 (i5) is read as reverse complement of barcoded PCR oligos for NextSeq, iSeq, and NovaSeq using the version 1.5 (reverse complement) chemistry. The CCHMC DNA Sequencing core is using version 1.5 chemistry for the NovaSeq.\n\n\n\nFor barcodes added via a PCR step (e.g. Tn5 Transposase Barcoding PCR Primers, Nextera; or through primers and stubby adapters):\n\nIndex 1 (i7) is always read as the reverse complement of the sequence in the TruSeq or Nextera style PCR oligos. The PCR primer sequence is the reverse complement of the product it generates. Don’t trust Ty to explain this to you.\nIndex 2 (i5) is read in the direction of the TruSeq or Nextera PCR oligos for Miseq and NovaSeq runs (v1 chemistry).\nIndex 2 (i5) is read as the reverse complement of barcoded PCR oligos for NextSeq, iSeq, and NovaSeq (v1.5 chemistry) runs."

    "text": "Installation\n\nQuick Start\nThis procedure requires you have pip installed. If you are using Linux, your distro may already provide a package.\n# if you are on the HPC cluster, you will need to load a python/3.x module\nmodule load python3\n\n# install the latest release from GitLab using pip\npip install --user https://tfinternal.research.cchmc.org/gitlab/databank/seq-core-ngs-downloader/-/archive/master/seq-core-ngs-downloader-master.zip\n\n# make sure it works; otherwise, see the 'Updating Your PATH' section below\nngsdl --help\n\n# …or try this as a backup\npython -m cchmc_seq_core --help\nOlder versions of pip may require you to download the and manually extract the .zip file from GitLab first, like this:\ncurl -LOJ https://tf.cchmc.org/s/e1f9a\nunzip seq-core-ngs-downloader*.zip && rm -f seq-core-ngs-downloader*.zip\ncd seq-core-ngs-downloader*\npip install --user .\n\n# optionally delete the downloaded source code\ncd .. && rm -rf seq-core-ngs-downloader*\n\nUpdating Your PATH\nIf you install with pip install --user, that precludes the need for a virtual environment (see below), but necessitates that you manually add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if you want to be able to run this script from an arbitrary directory:\n# recommended place for PATH modifications is ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile\ntest -f ~/.bash_profile && \\\n  echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile || \\\n  echo 'export PATH=\"$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH\"' &gt;&gt; ~/.profile\n\n# you will need to log out and back in to see the changes\nSome Linux distros do this by default now.\nOn a Mac, pip installs things to your (hidden) ~/Library folder. You will need to add $HOME/Library/Python/&lt;python_maj.minor_version&gt;/bin to your $PATH when using the system default Python, where &lt;python_maj.minor_version&gt; would be something like “2.7”, depending on which version of the OS you have.\n\n\n\nSetup for Local Development\nIf you are just experimenting, and don’t want to mess with setting your $PATH or potentially needing sudo to install, here’s a sure bet:\nGITLAB=https://tfwebdev.research.cchmc.org/gitlab\ngit clone $GITLAB/databank/seq-core-ngs-downloader\ncd seq-core-ngs-downloader\n\nvirtualenv venv      # or, possibly: python3 -m venv venv\n. venv/bin/activate  # activate the virtual environment\npip install -e .     # install using the 'setup.py' in the local directory\n\nngsdl --help         # make sure it works in the virtualenv\nThis repository includes a setuptools setup.py, which you can run in the usual way, if that’s your thing: python setup.py [--help | install]."

The default if you leave it off is to get all file types.\nIf this bothers you, the following small sed script will clean up some of the noise, while still preserving the experiment “headings”:\nngsdl -t fastq | sed '/^# /d; /^## --/d; /^$/d'\n\nGetting data files for a specific sequencing run\nTry something like this:\nngsdl | grep run0529 &gt; download.sh\n\n# or, pipe it to a shell to start the downloads directly\nngsdl | grep run0529 | bash"

Macrophages reside in all tissues, where they contribute to innate immune surveillance, clear cellular debris and promote repair in response to injuries. In addition, macrophages and other recruited mononuclear phagocytes participate in disease processes associated with obesity, allergic inflammation, suppression of anti-cancer immunity and neurodegeneration. Within each tissue, cell subtypes adopt specialized roles through unique combinations of niche-provided signals. As a result, macrophages and other recruited mononuclear phagocytes may diversify further during disease because of environmental perturbation. \nWe couple cellular and molecular immunology approaches to quantitative analyses of dynamic epigenetic factors ultimately controlling gene expression. With these approaches, we discover novel intercellular and intracellular mechanisms controlling tissue myeloid cell behaviors during health and disease.\n\nPrincipal Investigator\nTy D.

title: "Integrating RNA expression data with differential statistics from DeSeq2"

Purpose:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in normalized TPM expression data

```{r}
read_tsv("../Data/Source/rawT.txt") %>% colnames()

tpm <- read_tsv("../Data/Source/rawT.txt") %>% select(1:5) %>% rename(geneID = 1)
```

Read in DeSeq2 differential expression data for these selected comparisons

```{R}
diff <- read_tsv("../Data/Source/BALBcJ_F0_Control.vs.C57BL6J_F0_Control.scatter.txt") %>% rename(geneID = 1)
```

Now merge data together. This will invovle using the join functions that are part of dplyr. Dplyr has mutate joins (inner_join, full_join, right_join, left_join) and filter joins (semi_join and anti_join), including full_join, semi_join, left_join, right_join, inner_join, and I probably forgot a few.

For this case we want consider genes that meet minimal expression criteria and were included in the differential expression analysis. So we will use inner_join

```{R}
merge <-  inner_join(x = tpm, y = diff, by = "geneID")
mergeMean <- merge %>%
  mutate(meanBALB = (BALBcJ_F0_Control_BALB01C + BALBcJ_F0_Control_BALB01D) /
           2) %>%
  mutate(meanC57 = (C57BL6J_F0_Control_C5701C + C57BL6J_F0_Control_C5701D) /
           2)
```
